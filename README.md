I am realizing instrumentation the more applications sending your metrics, logs and traces to backends like Grafana-Tempo, Prometheus, Loki, theses datas will be displayed in the granfana-web.

Observation:

I built all the Docker Compose files, configs.yaml, and changed the application code with the purpose of learning about Instrumentation, Collector-OTPL, backends, etc.


This is in development...
